# Easy Transformer

## An implementation of transformers tailored for mechanistic interpretability.

It supports the importation of open sources models, a convenient handling of hooks
to get access to intermediate activations and features to perform simple emperiments such as ablations and patching.

A demo notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/Easy-Transformer/blob/main/EasyTransformer_Demo.ipynb) and a more comprehensive description of the library can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_tH4PfRSPYuKGnJbhC1NqFesOYuXrir_#scrollTo=zs8juArnyuyB)
